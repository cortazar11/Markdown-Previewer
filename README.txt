A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/cortazar11/pen/vROxxw.

This is one of my projects for Free Code Camp.

There are two windows. The window on the left is the editor where I write the markdown. 
The window on the right is where the text is rendered as HTML at the same time that I type in the editor.
